google_analytics_redirect
=========================

This is Chrome extension to redirect the Google Analytics homepage to the more useful location of https://www.google.com/analytics/web/#report/visitors-overview/

Warning:  I've never created a Chrome extension before and basically threw this together in 10 minutes after reading this thread on Reddit - http://www.reddit.com/r/web_design/comments/1wx88m/every_time_i_try_to_open_google_analytics/

Feel free to use it, improve it or whatever.

To install:
- Clone the repo somewhere.
- Open Chrome and goto chrome://extensions
- Click "Load unpacked extension..."
- Choose the repo folder you just cloned.

Thanks.
Dan
